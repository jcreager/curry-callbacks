This is a set of function currying examples.  Curry.js shows how to curry a synchronous function, as well as a asynchronous function.  UniversalCurry.js builds on the asynchronous curring function from curry.js to provide a universal currying function.  

This is based on a concept known as futures.  These are based on [Bruno Jouhier's ](https://bjouhier.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/currying-the-callback-or-the-essence-of-futures/) post on currying asynchronous functions.  The functions shown in universalCurry.js can be used for any asynchronous library.
